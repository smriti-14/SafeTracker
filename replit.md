# SafeZone Emergency System

## Overview

SafeZone is a real-time emergency zone detection application that helps users identify danger zones and safe areas during disasters. The system uses location data and network information to provide immediate safety alerts and guidance. Built with modern web technologies, it features a React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, utilizing PostgreSQL for data persistence through Drizzle ORM.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: Frontend-only with local state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI with shadcn/ui component library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with enhanced animations and glassmorphism effects
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Data Storage**: In-memory mock data for demonstration purposes

### Backend Architecture
- **Status**: Removed for frontend-only implementation
- **Previous**: Node.js with Express.js framework, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Current**: Pure frontend application using browser APIs only

## Key Components

### Core Features
1. **Location Services**: Geolocation API integration for precise user positioning
2. **Network Analysis**: Network Information API for connection quality assessment
3. **Zone Detection**: Real-time proximity calculations for danger and safe zones
4. **Interactive Mapping**: Custom canvas-based map visualization
5. **Emergency Communications**: Direct emergency calling functionality

### Database Schema
- **zones**: Stores danger and safe zone information with geographic coordinates
- **user_locations**: Tracks user positions with network metadata and session management

### Component Structure
- **Landing Page**: Marketing and feature overview
- **Application**: Main emergency detection interface
- **Dashboard**: Real-time zone monitoring and status display
- **Interactive Map**: Visual zone representation with user location
- **Zone Cards**: Detailed zone information and distance calculations

## Data Flow

1. **Location Acquisition**: Browser Geolocation API with enhanced error handling
2. **Network Assessment**: Network Information API for connection quality evaluation
3. **Zone Visualization**: Canvas API for interactive map rendering with zones
4. **Mock Data**: Static zone data for demonstration (Delhi-based locations)
5. **Real-time Updates**: Simulated zone monitoring with visual feedback
6. **Emergency Response**: Direct integration with Indian emergency services (100, 101, 102)

## External Dependencies

### Core Technologies
- **Browser APIs**: Geolocation API, Network Information API, Canvas API
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives for accessible component foundation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations and glassmorphism effects
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography

### Development Tools
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for compile-time error prevention
- **Schema Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking and validation
- **Database Migration**: Drizzle Kit for schema management
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Server**: Vite development server with hot module replacement
- **Database**: Environment-based connection string configuration
- **API Integration**: Proxy configuration for seamless frontend-backend communication

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Static asset generation with Vite build process
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundling for optimized server deployment
- **Database**: Migration-based schema deployment with Drizzle
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV-based configuration switching

### Scalability Considerations
- **Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL for automatic scaling
- **Caching**: In-memory storage implementation with migration path to Redis
- **API**: Stateless design for horizontal scaling capability
- **Frontend**: Static asset deployment with CDN optimization potential

The architecture prioritizes rapid development, type safety, and emergency response reliability while maintaining scalability for future enhancements.
